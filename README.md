I have compiled all these codes in an online compiler
you will have to change the name of files according my main class everytime after launching the code
(Most probably to TaskMonitoringTool.java)

all the test cases have a separate file for each
test suit is also in a separate file

Feel free to contact me anytime if you encounter any issues :)
